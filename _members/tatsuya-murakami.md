Pronouns: he, him, his.

Dr. Tatsuya Murakami is a research associate in Dr. Nathaniel Heintzâ€™s Laboratory of Molecular Biology at The Rockefeller University. His work explores the question of how psychotic symptoms in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders are represented in a cellular network. To address this question, he devised a novel imaging technique that enables spatial characterization of the transcriptome state of human brains in a disease state. Dr. Murakami obtained his M.Sc. in life science from Tsinghua University, and his Ph.D. in medical science from the University of Tokyo, where he conducted research in whole-mammalian brain single-cell-resolution imaging with Dr. Hiroki R. Ueda.
