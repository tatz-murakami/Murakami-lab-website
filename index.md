# Systems Neuroanatomy

My research aims to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. We integrate 3D single-cell-resolution imaging with deep learning, focusing on developing a suite of tools to standardize the human brain anatomy at the cellular level.

Powered by tissue clearing and whole-mount staining techniques, we untangle the molecular complexity of the brain at single-cell resolution.
